Kills go in order from 1-5, starting at a single kill (1) to an Ace (5).
Example: If you had a clip with a triple kill, you would use 'Kill 1'
for the first kill, 'Kill 2' for the double, then 'Kill 3' for the Triple!

Each kill has a different sound effect depending on how many you've
already got in the round.
